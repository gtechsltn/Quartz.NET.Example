# Quartz.NET Example App

# ------------------------------ IN PROGRESS ------------------------------ 

This example app demonstrates the usage of JobFactory, JobListener, and other key components in Quartz.NET.

## Overview

Quartz.NET is a feature-rich job scheduling library that can be integrated into your .NET applications. This example showcases how to use Quartz.NET to schedule and manage jobs, along with utilizing JobFactory and JobListener for custom job execution and monitoring.

## Features

- **Job Scheduling**: Demonstrate how to schedule jobs using Quartz.NET.
- **JobFactory**: Implement a custom JobFactory to instantiate job instances with dependencies injected.
- **JobListener**: Implement a custom JobListener to monitor job executions and scheduler linked jobs.
